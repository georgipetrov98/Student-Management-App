# Student-Management-App
A windows forms application for managing students

For this project I used C#. This project is meant to depict a Student Management System.

It was built with C# and uses Object-Oriented programming concepts. It has a Student List that displays all the students and data about them like names,grades,etc. You as a lecturer have options to manipulate that data like adding next students, changing their names, groups and other. There are also some quality of life functions like sorting the tables, updating them, seriliazing them to a file. You can also import Excel spreadsheets of students and Bulk assign students to groups and create new groups.
